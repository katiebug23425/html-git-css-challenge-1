# html-git-css-chalenge-1

## Description

First challenge for our online bootcamp class using html, git and css we learned from week 1

My motivation was to refactor the code to optimize it for search engines and make it more accessible.

By adding semantic html tags and repairing links making the webpage rank higher in seo and more acessible. 

I built this project to create a better website for the marketing company and to ensure that it is accessible for everyone
